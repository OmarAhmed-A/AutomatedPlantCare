# Automated Plant Care

## Description

This Project uses the PIC16f877a microcontroller to automate the care of plants. The system is designed to monitor the soil moisture and temperature of the plant and water the plant when the soil moisture is below a certain threshold. The system also has a temperature sensor to monitor the temperature of the plant. The system has a user interface that allows the user to set the threshold for the soil moisture and temperature. The system also has a display that shows the current soil moisture and temperature of the plant. The system has a water pump that waters the plant when the soil moisture is below the threshold.

## Components

- PIC16f877a microcontroller
- Soil moisture sensor
- DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor
- 16x2 LCD display
- Water pump
- ESP32 microcontroller (to run the web server)
